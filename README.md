# fillpattern

This code produces an image demonstrating how a 3d printing fill pattern might look. It should probably be made gyroidal. It should also be tried out on real prints using a real 3d printer. It may have better compression strength for the same amount of fill compared to other fill patterns because it's more amorphous and leverages intersections while spacing them out.
